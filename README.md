Abstractâ€” Predicting the outcome of a game has always been an area of immense interest among sports fans as well as the bookmakers. To make an informed guess, researchers have previously tried to use numerous machine learning techniques like Bayesian nets, logistic regression, decision trees classifier and even basic neural nets but none have explored using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sports prediction. This paper intends to predict the result of an English Premier League (EPL) game using the 'European Soccer Database' from Kaggle.com. Football pundits have touted form as one of the most crucial factors when trying to predict the outcome of a game. To take this parameter into account and give it more weight, we have formulated this as a time-series problem, trying to leverage the natural architecture of RNN combined with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) for sequential problems.
